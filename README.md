# Giftly 🎁

A mobile-first gifting delivery MVP. Customers browse gifts from local stores and send
them to someone with a message; store owners fulfill their own orders; admins oversee the
whole platform. **Demo application — no real payments or deliveries.**

Built with Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL.

---

## 1. Tech stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router, TypeScript) on Vercel
- **PostgreSQL** (Neon via Vercel Marketplace, or any Postgres instance)
- **Prisma ORM** — schema + committed migrations in `prisma/`
- **Prisma Client runs in "no Rust engine" mode** (`queryCompiler` + `driverAdapters` +
  `engineType = "client"` in `prisma/schema.prisma`, with `@prisma/adapter-pg`). This is
  Prisma's own documented architecture for serverless/edge deployments — it removes the
  native query-engine binary entirely, which means smaller, faster Vercel builds. See
  https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine
- **Tailwind CSS**, **lucide-react** icons, a small set of hand-built + Radix-based UI
  primitives (no full shadcn CLI dependency, to keep the dependency tree predictable)
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for forms and shared client/server validation
- **jose** for signed, HttpOnly, expiring session cookies (custom lightweight auth — no
  third-party auth provider needed for a demo-login-only app)
- **Vitest** for unit + integration tests

## 2. Local setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- A PostgreSQL database (local Postgres, or a free Neon project — see §5)

### Steps

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL, and SESSION_SECRET
npx prisma migrate deploy   # applies the committed migration in prisma/migrations/
npm run db:seed             # seeds demo cities, stores, products, orders, and accounts
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000
```

> `npm install` runs `prisma generate` automatically via `postinstall`. The first time you
> run any Prisma command, it downloads a small schema-engine binary from
> `binaries.prisma.sh` (a one-time, normal step) — make sure outbound network access to
> that host is available in whatever environment you install in.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Pooled Postgres connection string, used at runtime |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Yes (for migrations) | Direct (non-pooled) Postgres connection, used by `prisma migrate` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Random secret (32+ bytes) used to sign session cookies. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |

If `DATABASE_URL` is missing, every page and API route returns a clear
"setup required" message (HTTP 503) instead of silently falling back to a fake backend.

### Demo credentials

All demo accounts use the password **`Demo@1234`**.

| Role | Email | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | `customer@giftapp.demo` | Has seeded orders GF-1001, 1002, 1003 |
| Customer | `customer2@giftapp.demo` | Second customer, for access-isolation testing |
| Store Owner | `store@giftapp.demo` | Owns **Petals & Co.** (Hyderabad) — has a pending order |
| Store Owner | `cakecraft@giftapp.demo` | Owns **CakeCraft** (Hyderabad) |
| Store Owner | `giftstudio@giftapp.demo` | Owns **The Gift Studio** (Hyderabad) |
| Store Owner | `bloom@giftapp.demo` | Owns **Bloom & Co.** (Hyderabad) |
| Store Owner | `cakecraft.blr@giftapp.demo` | Owns **CakeCraft** (Bengaluru) — demonstrates city filtering |
| Admin | `admin@giftapp.demo` | Platform-wide visibility and overrides |

The `/login` page also has one-tap "Use demo Customer / Store Owner / Admin" buttons.

**Testing multiple roles at once:** use separate browser profiles or private/incognito
windows per role — ordinary tabs in the same browser share the same session cookie, so a
second tab logging in as a different role will replace the first tab's session too.

## 3. Database notes

- Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`. Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260101000000_init/`.
- All monetary values are `Decimal(10,2)`; delivery fees are fixed (₹49 standard, ₹99
  express, ₹79 scheduled) and totals are **always recalculated server-side** — the client's
  displayed total is only used to detect drift and force a re-review.
- `Order.version` is used for optimistic concurrency: every status transition checks and
  increments it, so a stale/concurrent update is rejected with a clear conflict error
  rather than silently overwriting a newer change.
- `OrderStatusHistory` is append-only and immutable; admin overrides are recorded there
  with `isAdminOverride = true` and a mandatory reason, and nothing is ever deleted or
  rewritten. "Skipped" steps in the tracking timeline are *derived* at render time by
  comparing the current status against which steps have a real recorded timestamp — no
  fabricated timestamps are ever written to the database.
- Editing a product never changes past orders: `OrderItem` snapshots `productName` and
  `unitPrice` at the moment the order is placed.

### Resetting local data

```bash
npm run db:reset:dev   # truncates all tables - refuses to run if NODE_ENV=production
npm run db:seed        # repopulate
```

This script is a CLI-only tool, not an HTTP endpoint — it's never reachable from the
deployed app.

## 4. Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Start the production server (after `build`) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run test` | Run the Vitest suite (needs `DATABASE_URL` for integration tests) |
| `npm run db:generate` | `prisma generate` |
| `npm run db:migrate` | `prisma migrate deploy` (production-safe, no prompts) |
| `npm run db:migrate:dev` | `prisma migrate dev` (local, interactive) |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed demo data (idempotent — safe to re-run) |
| `npm run db:reset:dev` | Dev-only: truncate all tables |

## 5. Deploying to Vercel + Neon

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, **New Project** → import the repo.
3. Add a **Neon Postgres** integration from the Vercel Marketplace (or connect your own
   Postgres). This sets `DATABASE_URL` and a pooled/direct URL pair automatically — map
   them to `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` in Vercel's Environment Variables if the
   integration uses different names.
4. Add `SESSION_SECRET` as an environment variable (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`).
   **Never** prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
5. Deploy. Vercel runs `npm install` (which runs `prisma generate` via `postinstall`) and
   `npm run build` automatically.
6. Run the migration against your production database once, from your local machine or a
   one-off Vercel CLI command:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="<your production DATABASE_URL>" npx prisma migrate deploy
   DATABASE_URL="<your production DATABASE_URL>" npm run db:seed
   ```
   Do **not** run the seed or migration automatically on every deploy.
7. Keep a separate Neon branch/database for preview deployments if you want preview and
   production data isolated (Neon's branching feature is well suited to this).

## 6. A three-role demo walkthrough

1. Open `/login` in one browser profile → **Use demo Customer**. Pick Hyderabad, browse to
   **Petals & Co.** → **Blush Love Bouquet** → place a mock order. You'll land on the
   confirmation screen: *"Order placed — waiting for the store to accept."*
2. Open a **second, separate browser profile** → `/login` → **Use demo Store Owner**
   (`store@giftapp.demo`). Go to **Orders** → find the new order → **Accept** → advance it
   through Preparing Gift → Ready for Pickup → Out for Delivery → Delivered.
3. Back in the customer tab, open **My Orders** → tap the order → the tracking timeline
   reflects each update (polls every 15s, or tap Refresh).
4. Open a **third profile** → `/login` → **Use demo Admin**. Go to **Orders**, open the
   same order, and try **Override status** — pick any status, give a reason, confirm. The
   immutable history list shows the override with its reason, actor, and timestamp, and
   nothing is deleted from the record of what the store owner actually did.

## 7. Known limitations / what's intentionally out of scope

Per the product brief, this MVP deliberately does **not** include: a shopping cart or
multi-store orders, real payment processing, a rider app or live delivery tracking,
registration/OTP/password-recovery flows, coupons, or a full support/ticketing platform.
"Occasion reminders" and "Group gifting" are shown as **Coming soon** placeholders on the
home screen, per spec.

## 8. What was verified before delivery

Everything below was actually run, not assumed:

- `npm run typecheck` — 0 errors
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors (3 informational warnings, documented in code comments)
- `npm run build` — succeeds; all 35 routes compile, correctly split between static and
  dynamic
- `npm run test` — **39/39 tests passing**, including integration tests that exercise
  `createOrder`, store-owner transitions, admin overrides, and price-snapshot integrity
  against a real PostgreSQL database (not mocks)
- A hand-written SQL migration was applied to a real Postgres instance and a full
  create → read → delete smoke test confirmed Prisma Client works correctly in the
  no-Rust-engine / driver-adapter configuration
- A full HTTP smoke test against the running production build: login → session cookie
  issuance → unauthenticated requests correctly blocked (401) → cross-role requests
  correctly blocked (403) → a real order placed → idempotent retry returned the same
  order (no duplicate) → the store owner saw and accepted it → the customer's tracking
  view reflected the update → the admin overrode the status with a reason and the
  override was recorded in the immutable history
- The seed script was run against a real database and confirmed idempotent (a second run
  skips existing records rather than duplicating them)

No deployment or GitHub repository URL is claimed here, since creating those requires your
own GitHub/Vercel/Neon accounts — the steps above are exact and ready to follow.
